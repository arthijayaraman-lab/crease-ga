# Introduction
Computational Reverse Engineering Analysis for Scattering Experiments (CREASE) originally developed by Daniel Beltran-Villegas, Michiel Wessels, and Arthi Jayaraman (References 1, 2, and 3 below) is a two step approach that takes as input small angle scattering profile [I(q) vs. q] and provides as output structural information of the assembled structure.  It combines a genetic algorithm (GA) as the first step with molecular simulations based reconstruction as the second step. For macromolecular solutions at dilute concentrations, when the primary component of [I(q) vs. q] is the form factor of the assembled structure, the two steps of CREASE provide structural information about the assembled structure ranging from dimensions of the domains as well as the chain- and monomer- level packing (as shown in References 1, 2, 3, and 5). The work in Reference 4 below describes early implementation of CREASE to analyze input small angle scattering profiles when the structure factor is the primary component of I(q) vs. q. 

This open source crease_ga package has been co-created by Zijie Wu, Ziyu Ye, Christian Heil, and Arthi Jayaraman at University of Delaware.

# Installation
To install this package on a linux machine, follow these steps:

1. We will be using Anaconda to handle the python environment. So first, we need to [install anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html) on our machine. You can also consider installing [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for faster installation and lower storage consumption (Note: Miniconda installation package  does not include the 'Anaconda command prompt'. See step 2 for detail)

1. Afterwards, you will need a bash terminal to work with. If you are on a linux or MacOS machine, you can directly launch the terminal. If you are on a Windows machine, you can consider installing [Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL)](https://ubuntu.com/wsl), or directly use the 'Anaconda prompt' app that comes with anaconda installation. (should be accessible from the Start Menu if you have completed step 1 correctly).

1. Download the package. If you have git installed, this can be done using the following command from a terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/arthijayaraman-lab/crease_ga
```

Or download directly from github webpage by following the guidance [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository)

1. Create a new conda environment and install all the dependencies. 
   - Navigate into the root directory of the cloned package, and create a fresh conda environment with dependencies using
     ```
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     ```
   - Activate the environment with
     ```
     conda activate crease_ga
     ```

1. Install the `crease_ga` package using
   ```
   pip install .
   ```
You are all set to use the `crease_ga` package! Remember to activate the proper environment every time by with `conda activate crease_ga`. You can run the Jupyter notebook tutorials by using
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```

- **NOTE**: if you intend to run this on a supercomputing cluster, you will need to follow the steps to create a python environment of the corresponding cluster.

# Getting started
Follow the jupyter notebook tutorials (CREASE_vesicles_tutorial-NEW.ipynb) in the `Tutorials` folder, or refer to our documentations at readthedocs.io (currently under construction).

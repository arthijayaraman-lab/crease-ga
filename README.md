# Introduction
Computational Reverse Engineering Analysis for Scattering Experiments (CREASE) originally developed by Daniel Beltran-Villegas, Michiel Wessels, and Arthi Jayaraman (References 1, 2, and 3 below) is a two step approach that takes as input small angle scattering profile [I(q) vs. q] and provides as output structural information of the assembled structure.  For macromolecular solutions at dilute concentrations, when the primary component of [I(q) vs. q] is the form factor of the assembled structure, CREASE provides structural information about the assembled structure ranging from dimensions of the domains as well as the chain- and monomer- level packing (as shown in References 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7). For macromolecular solutions at high concentrations, I(q) vs. q has both form factor and structure factor information; References 6 and 8 show how CREASE can be applied for these systems.

This open source `crease_ga` package was co-created by Zijie Wu, Ziyu Ye, Christian Heil, and Arthi Jayaraman at University of Delaware. Currently `crease_ga` package is maintained by Zijie Wu, Nitant Gupta, and Stephen Kronenberger.

# Installation

To install this package on a Windows, linux, or macOS machine, follow these steps:

1. We will be using Anaconda to handle the python environment. So first, we need to [install anaconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html) on our machine. You can also consider installing [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for faster installation and lower storage consumption _only if you are an advanced user_. We recommend installing the full version of anaconda if you have limited experience with python and/or computer programming.

1. At this point, you will need a bash terminal to work with. All the installation steps _after_ this step will need to be accomplished from a terminal, using command line interface. 
    - If you are on a linux or MacOS machine
    
       You can directly launch a terminal.
    - If you are on a Windows machine
    
       If you have installed the full version of Anaconda/Miniconda in Step 1, the most straightforward way to launch a terminal will be using _Anaconda prompt_ that comes with the conda installation. You should be able to find _Anaconda prompt_ from your Start menu. You can also consider installing [Windows Subsytem for Linux (WSL)](https://ubuntu.com/wsl).

1. Download the package. 
   - If you have git installed, this can be done using the following command from a terminal:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/arthijayaraman-lab/crease_ga
     ```
   - You can also directly download the package as a ZIP file from [our github webpage](https://github.com/arthijayaraman-lab/crease_ga) by following the guidance [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository). If you are following this route, you will need to unzip the package to your desired location after the download.

1. Create a new conda environment and install the package and all its dependencies. 
   - _Navigate into the root directory of the cloned package_. If you are using the anaconda prompt, you can look up [common windows command line prompts](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~sedwards/classes/2015/1102-fall/Command%20Prompt%20Cheatsheet.pdf). If you are using a unix-based terminal (linux, macOS, or WSL subsystem), you can look up [common commands for Unix](http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~valerie/courses/fall10/155/resources/unix_cheatsheet.html). Either case, all you will need would probably be _displaying list of files and directories in the current folder_(`dir` for windows, `ls` for unix), and _moving to different directories_(`cd [new_directory_path]` for both windows and unix). You should end up at a directory called `crease_ga` and be able to see files named `setup.py`, `environment.yml` and `README.md` (among others) in the directory.
   - create a fresh conda environment with the package and its dependencies installed using
     ```
     conda env create -f environment.yml
     ```
   - Activate the environment with
     ```
     conda activate crease_ga
     ```

To test if the `crease-ga` package is installed properly, run
```
python3
```
to launch python, and then in the resulting python command line, run
```
import crease_ga
crease_ga.__version__
```

If all installation steps are done properly, you should see the version number of the package printed, and you are all set to use the `crease_ga` package! Remember to activate the proper environment every time by with `conda activate crease_ga`.

- **NOTE1**: We are in the process of preparing a new tutorial based on recent advances in machine learning enhanced CREASE. It will be available in September 2023. We plan to offer a workshop and tutorial in September 2023. If you are interested in attending that, please email us at creasejayaramanlab AT gmail.com.


- **NOTE2**: if you intend to run this on a supercomputing cluster, you will need to follow the steps to create a python environment of the corresponding cluster.

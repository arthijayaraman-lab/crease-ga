How does crease_ga support different chemistries (vesicle, micelles, fibrils, etc.)?

Do I have to use Debye scattering equation to evaluate scattering profile (I(q))? Can I use known analytical models, trained neural network models, etc.?

With the crease_ga package, we aim to provide a general framework for analyzing scattering profiles using genetic algorithm (GA). The crease_ga-vesicle tutorial provides a example implementation of this workflow, which consists of two parts: 

#.
        A method to evaluate scattering profile from a set of input parameters is defined (in the vesicle example, placing scatterers based on defined dimensions, and calculating scattering profile using Debye scattering equation)

#.
        Genetic algorithm (GA) for iteratively evaluating scattering profile from a variety of candidates using algorithm defined in part 1, and searching the "best" set of input parameters that produce the most similar scattering profile with the user-provided target.

The second part is largely universal for all possible crease_ga calculations, and the first part, which can be broadly defined as a process of â€œobtaining a scattering profile from a certain genome (a set of parameters)", differs by the chemistry of interest (vesicelles, micelles, fibrils, etc.), the chosen algorithm to evaluate I(q) (SASView-like analytical models, or debye scattering equation as in the vesicles example, or a pretrained neural network, etc.), and other details (parallelization, assumed distribution of dispersity, etc.). The detailed implementation of this step is delegated to a collection of implementations called "shapes".

**NOTE**: In this context, "shapes" not only handle difference in the assumed morphology of the chemistry, but also all the other aformentioned details, such as algorithms, parallelization implementation, and so on. So for example, a method to calculate I(q) of vesicles using Debye equation, and a method also to calculate I(q) of vesicles, but using some analytical models, should be considered as two different "shapes". In a more extreme case, two methods to calculate I(q) of fibrils using Debye equation, but one assuming dispersity in fibril radius following Gaussian distributon, and the other assuming dispersity in fibril radius following Schultz distribution, should alos be ocnsdered as two different "shapes", as these different assumptions lead to different implementation along the pathway from input parameters to computed scattering profile.

Currently, we only support two builtin "shapes" in crease_ga codebase: the vesicle model as implemented in Ye, Wu and Jayaraman (under review), and the micelle model as implemented in `Beltran-Villegas et al.  <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.9b08028>`_
. Both "shapes" are copied as-is from the articles, but without any parallelization, to facilitate the usage of these "shapes" in jupyter notebook for pedagogical purposes. While we plan to expand the codebase to include other "shapes" we have developed and are developing, we also encourage users to implement their own shapes of interest.

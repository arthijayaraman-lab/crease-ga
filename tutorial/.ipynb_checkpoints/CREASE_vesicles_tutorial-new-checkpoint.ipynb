    "\n",
    "Let's start with the initial arguments that the user needs to choose and input for their system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell block below, the user needs to define the arguments that define the basic architecture of the genetic algorithm:\n",
    "* number of individuals in a population ('pop_number')\n",
    "* number of generations that GA runs for ('generations')\n",
    "* number of binary digits used to represent each individual ('nloci')\n",
    "\n",
    "The user chooses the number of individual candidate structures in the population and the number of generations to run the GA. The choice of these three arguments are not trivial, and will significantly affect the performance of the GA. If starting from scratch, one should test out which combination of these three parameters can ensure a reliable convergence to a good prediction. Here, since we have already performed these tests during our previous work, we recommend the following values for these arguments to produce accurate matches to the target structure's $I$(q) runs:\n",
    "* `pop_number = 80`\n",
    "* `generations = 100`\n",
    "* `nloci = 7`\n",
    "\n",
    "But for the purpose of this tutorial, to make sure that we can finish the run within a reasonable amount of time even on a PC, we use the following values:\n",
    "* `pop_number = 5`\n",
    "* `generations = 5`\n",
    "* `nloci = 7`\n",
    "\n",
    "You should not expect to see an accurate match to the target $I$(q) with these settings. However, you could probably see how of our predictions evolve over the generations to higher \"fitness\" structures (i.e. closer match to the target).\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the parameters (or genome) fitted by GA, it is encoded as a seven-digit (chosen by the user as $n_{loci}$, set in this tutorial as 7) binary sequence that corresponds to the value of solutions evenly distributed between the maximum and minimum bounds set by the user (minimum bound will be 0000000, and maximum 1111111). The choice of the number of binary digits will determine the precision of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Wait, why are we encoding the parameters in a binary fashion?*\n",
    "That is a great question! Actually, whether to use binary or decimal encoding has always been a topic of debate in the field of genetic algorithm. Traditional GAs tend to use binary coding (referred to as 'binary-coded GA'), but there also have been numerous applications of GA to engineering problems using \"decimal coding\" (often referred to as 'real-coded GA'). We happen to have been developing the algorithm following the binary coding route, but there is technically no reason why we cannot use real-coded GA for this problem. It is just that our genetic operator algorithms (more later) would need to be redesigned if we were to use real-coded GA!"

In this example, we load in the `vesicle` shape, which requires the following 7 shape descriptors (specified as a list given in the following order with the `shape_params` argument):\n",

    "For vesicles assembled from amphiphilic macromolecules with solvophilic A and solvophobic B blocks, two types of scatterers (A and B, respectively) are randomly placed within the designated vesicle layer boundaries (more details to be given later). The ratio of A and B scatterers matches the composition of the amphiphilic macromolecule ( 1‚àíùëìùëè ,  ùëìùëè ). We note that the scatterers could be point scatterers or scatterers with a specified diameter, as is the case in this example. Regardless of the choice, the total number of A and B scatterers is another choice that the user has to make to balance the accuracy of the output vesicle dimensions from GA and the computational intensity of the ùêºùëêùëúùëöùëù(q) calculation (more details to be given later).\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The determination of ùêºùëêùëúùëöùëù(q) in the GA only uses the scatterer placements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this vesicle system example, the user can enter the molecular information about the solution that was used to obtain the scattering profile to guide the choice of number of scatterers placed in the individual candidate structure. Here for this tutorial example, we use the molecular information for a diblock copolymer with the solvophilic block A and solvophobic block B forming the vesicle bilayer. The diblock chain has total number of  ùëÅ  beads with  ùëìùëè  fraction of the beads in the chain being solvophobic. The packing density of the solvophobic beads in the middle layer is given by $\\rho_B$ and the diameters of the A an B beads (or \"monomer contour length\") are given by $l_{mono,a}$ and $l_{mono,b}$, respectively. The specific values used in this example are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this vesicle system example, we calculate each individual's ùêºùëêùëúùëöùëù(q) using seven different configurations (`nLP`) of random scatterer placements to generate the averaged ùêºùëêùëúùëöùëù(q). Having multiple configurations of scatterer placements mitigates the chance of any one configuration of scatterer placements within the vesicle dimension from biasing the computed scattering intensity. One could also choose to replace the use of multiple (`nLP=7` in this case) placements of fewer scatterers with just one placement using a significantly higher total number of scatterers per unit volume (i.e., scatterer density) which will lead to reduced biasing one may see upon using fewer scatterers (or smaller scatterer density). We choose to use multiple different configurations of random scatterer placements in this case to incorporate the ability to capture dispersity (more details to be given later).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed discussion on the scatterer placement and density in the case of CREASE for vesicles, please see reference [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setting bounds for GA parameters**\n",
    "\n",
    "The user also sets the maximum (`maxvalu`) and minimum (`minvalu`) bounds for each parameter (or genome) of the individual candidate structure. For the vesicle system example, the GA determines th following parameters:\n",
    "* Core radius ($R_{core}$), \n",
    "* Three individual layer thicknesses in the bilayer consisting of the inner solvophilic A layer ($t_{Ain}$), middle solvophobic B layer ($t_{B}$), and the outer solvophilic A layer ($t_{Aout}$), \n",
    "* Split of the solvophilic scatterers between inner ($s_{Ain}$) and outer layers,\n",
    "* Polydispersity in vesicle size as implemented in the core radius dimension ($\\sigma_{R}$).\n",
    "* Background intensity as -log10($bg$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The first 5 parameters can be in arbitrary units, but the units should be consistent, since in the algorithm, all values are passed in as unitless numbers. For the `vesicle` shape, all length units are coded in Angstrom, and `q` is given in $A^{-1}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to reiterate, different shapes will have different sets of shape descriptors and parameters, so the aforementioned list of descriptors and their definitions only applies to the **`vesicle`** shape. It is important for the user to make sure that the shape descriptors and minimum/maximum bounds correspond to the expectation of the chosen shape.\n",

For example, SASVIEW uses $\\chi^{2}$ to quantify the goodness of fit by taking the direct difference squared between the computed and target dataset over the fitted q range weighted by the squared error at each q. If the error associated with each q is known, $\\chi^{2}$ can similarly be implemented into the fitness function in CREASE to account for uncertainty in I(q) at each q. We plan to incorporate $\\chi^{2}$ as another option for fitness metric in a future release coming soon.\n",

Each shape will have its own `converttoIQ` that takes as input a list of q values (`qrange`) and a list of shape-specific parameters (the \"gene\"), and outputs a list of $I_{comp}$(q) value corresponding to the input `qrange`.

    "\n",
    "If the above codes for the example vesicle system in this tutorial have been successfully run, then the user should be able to see the best individual's $I_{comp}$(q) plotted against the input $I_{exp}$(q). With the small population size (`popnumber = 5`) and number of generations (`generations = 5`) used in this tutorial example, the resulting best individual structure is unlikely to be a good match to the target $I_{exp}$(q). As mentioned previously, using a small number of individuals and generations in this example is to keep the calculations computationally feasible and to produce accurate matches to the target $I_{exp}$(q) one would need to use significantly higher number of individuals and generations on more powerful computer.\n",

Progression from the initial generation to the final generation is shown with increasingly warmer colors.*\n",
    "\n",
    "From the best individual's $I_{comp}$(q) over multiple generations, we can see that increasing the population size and number of generation gradually drives the GA determined vesicle structure towards that of the target structure (**Figure 1**). We can also make a direct comparison of the GA determined vesicle dimensions to the known target dimensions and also to the dimensions determined through the traditional analytical model fitting of scattering profiles using packages like SASVIEW.\n",

    "**Figure 2**: *GA determined dimensions of relevant vesicle features at the end of 100 generations for the cases where dispersity in dimensions is not accounted for in the GA step (blue triangles) and when dispersity is incorporated into the GA (orange squares). The target dimensions of the in silico Iexp(q) are shown as open circles with 20% dispersity in the core radius (Rcore) dimensions. SASVIEW fitting results using the core-multi-shell model (grey stars) are offset to the right of the target dimensions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed during the tutorial, GA for vesicles can incorporate the effect of dispersity in the dimensions of the assembly into the calculation of the individual's $I_{comp}$(q) and this dispersity is determined as one of the GA results given as $\\sigma_{R}$ in this example systems where dispersity is incorporated in the core radius dimension. **Figure 2** shows how the GA with (i.e. GA searches and optimizes for $\\sigma_{R}$) and without (i.e. GA sets $\\sigma_{R} = 0$) dispersity performs in getting the vesicle structural dimensions of core radius ($R_{core}$), each layer thickness ($t_{A,in}$, $t_{B}$, $t_{A,out}$) and total vesicle diameter size ($D_{vesicle}$). We can see that with an appropriate population size and number of generations, the GA is able to accurately capture the target structure's dimensions. Additionally, while the analytical fitting to a core-multi-shell model using SASVIEW can also determine these structural dimensions, GA for vesicle is able to inform the user how the molecules are split between the inner and outer layers of the vesicle wall ($s_{Ain}$), a piece of molecular information not available to traditional method of analytical fitting. The GA determined parameter $s_{Ain}$ gives the fraction of molecules in the vesicle assembly that occupies the inner layer of the vesicle walls. For this example system, the target structure has 20% of the molecules in the assembly occupying the inner layer of the vesicle wall and the GA is able to determine $s_{Ain}$ as 28%, well matching the target value.\n",

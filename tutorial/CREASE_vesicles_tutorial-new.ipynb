    "Computational Reverse Engineering Analysis for Scattering Experiments (CREASE) is a two step approach that combines a genetic algorithm (GA) as the first step with molecular simulations based reconstruction as the second step to determine structural features of assembled structures from aggregate dimensions to the chain- and monomer- level packing for a given input scattering profile. \n",

    "Let's start with the initial arguments that the user needs to choose and input for their system. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the cell block below, the user needs to define two sets of arguments: those that defines the basic architecture of the genetic algorithm, includng:\n",
    "* number of individuals in a population (pop_number)\n",
    "* number of generations that GA runs for (generations)\n",
    "* number of binary digits used to represent each individual (nloci)\n",
    "\n",
    "The user chooses the number of individuals in the population and the number of generations to run the GA (note: in this example we use 5 for both the number of individuals in the population and the number of generations to keep the calculations computationally feasible in this tutorial. To produce accurate matches to the target structure's $I$(q) one would need to use significantly higher number of individuals and generations on more powerful computer.). For each of the parameters to be fit (or genome) using GA, it is encoded as a seven-digit (chosen by the user as $n_{loci}$, here set as 7) binary sequence that is evenly distributed between the maximum and minimum bounds set by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second set of arguments are passed in with the `load_chemistry` method and define the shape of interest. In this example, we load in the shape `vesicle`, and set up some shape descriptors (`chemistry_params`) that a user needs to define. The 7 shape descriptors here are:\n",
    "* number of scatterers per chain ($num_{scatterers}$)\n",
    "* Number of beads on chain ($N$)\n",
    "* density/volume fraction of beads in B layer ($rho_B$)\n",
    "* Angstrom 'monomer contour length' ($l_{mono,b}）\n",
    "* Angstrom 'monomer cminontour length' ($l_{mono,a}）\n",
    "* fraction of B type monomers in chain ($fb$)\n",
    "* number of replicates ($n_{LP}$)\n",
    "\n",
    "The A and B type scatterers are randomly placed within the designated vesicle layer boundaries (more details to be given later) and the ratio of A and B scatterers matches the composition of the amphiphilic macromolecule ( 1−𝑓𝑏 ,  𝑓𝑏 ). These A and B scatterers could be point scatterers or scatterers with a specified diameter, as is the case in this example. Regardless of the choice, the total number of A and B scatterers is another choice the user has to make to balance the accuracy of the output vesicle dimensions from GA and the computational intensity of the  𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 (q) calculation (more details to be given later).\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: The determination of  𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 (q) in the GA only uses the scatterer placements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this vesicle system example, the user can enter the molecular information about the solution that was used to obtain the scattering profile to guide the choice of number of scatterers placed in the individual candidate structure. Here for this tutorial example, we use the molecular information for a diblock copolymer with the solvophilic block A and solvophobic block B forming the vesicle bilayer. The diblock chain has total number of  𝑁  beads with  𝑓𝑏  fraction of the beads in the chain being solvophobic. The packing density of the solvophobic beads in the middle layer is given by  𝜌𝐵  and the diameters of the A an B beads (or \"monomer contour length\") are given by  𝑙𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑜,𝑎  and  𝑙𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑜,𝑏 , respectively. The specific values used in this example are given below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this vesicle system example, we calculate each individual's  𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 (q) using seven different configurations (nLP) of random scatterer placements to generate the averaged  𝐼𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑝 (q). Having multiple configurations of scatterer placements mitigates the chance of any one configuration of scatterer placements within the vesicle dimension from biasing the computed scattering intensity. One could also choose to replace the use of multiple (nLP=7in this case) placements of fewer scatterers with just one placement using a significantly higher total number of scatterers per unit volume (i.e., scatterer density) which will lead to reduced biasing one may see upon using fewer scatterers (or smaller scatterer density). We choose to use multiple different configurations of random scatterer placements in this case to incorporate the ability to capture dispersity (more details to be given later).\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more detailed discussion on the scatterer placement and density in the case of CREASE for vesicles, please see reference [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is also where the user can set the maximum and minimum bounds for each parameter (or genome) of the individual. For the vesicle system example, the parameters that the GA determines are:\n",
    "* core radius ($R_{core}$), \n",
    "* three individual layer thicknesses in the bilayer consisting of the inner solvophilic A layer ($t_{Ain}$), middle solvophobic B layer ($t_{B}$), and the outer solvophilic A layer ($t_{Aput}$), \n",
    "* split of the solvophilic scatterers between inner ($s_{Ain}$) and outer layers,\n",
    "* polydispersity in vesicle size as implemented in the core radius dimension ($\\sigma_{R}$).\n",
    "* background intensity ($background$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Different shapes will have different sets of shape descriptors and parameters. It is important for the user to make sure the shape descriptors and minimum/maximum bound defined matches the expectation of the corresponding shape.\n",
    "**TODO: Add a reference to the table of shape descriptors and parameters**"

    "If the above codes for the example vesicle system in this tutorial have been successfully run, then the user should be able to see the best individual's $I_{comp}$(q) plotted against the input $I_{exp}$(q). With the small population size (`popnumber = 5`) and number of generations (`generations = 5`) used in this tutorial example, the resulting best individual structure is unlikely to be a good match to the target $I_{exp}$(q). As mentioned previously, using a small number of individuals and generations in this example is to keep the calculations computationally feasible and to produce accurate matches to the target $I_{exp}$(q) one would need to use significantly higher number of individuals and generations on more powerful computer.\n",

Progression from the initial generation to the final generation is shown with increasingly warmer colors.*\n",
    "\n",
    "From the best individual's $I_{comp}$(q) over multiple generations, we can see that increasing the population size and number of generation gradually drives the GA determined vesicle structure towards that of the target structure (**Figure 1**). We can also make a direct comparison of the GA determined vesicle dimensions to the known target dimensions and also to the dimensions determined through the traditional analytical model fitting of scattering profiles using packages like SASVIEW.\n",

    "**Figure 2**: *GA determined dimensions of relevant vesicle features at the end of 100 generations for the cases where dispersity in dimensions is not accounted for in the GA step (blue triangles) and when dispersity is incorporated into the GA (orange squares). The target dimensions of the in silico Iexp(q) are shown as open circles with 20% dispersity in the core radius (Rcore) dimensions. SASVIEW fitting results using the core-multi-shell model (grey stars) are offset to the right of the target dimensions.*\n",
    "\n",
    "As discussed during the tutorial, GA for vesicles can incorporate the effect of dispersity in the dimensions of the assembly into the calculation of the individual's $I_{comp}$(q) and this dispersity is determined as one of the GA results given as $\\sigma_{R}$ in this example systems where dispersity is incorporated in the core radius dimension. **Figure 2** shows how the GA with (i.e. GA searches and optimizes for $\\sigma_{R}$) and without (i.e. GA sets $\\sigma_{R} = 0$) dispersity performs in getting the vesicle structural dimensions of core radius ($R_{core}$), each layer thickness ($t_{A,in}$, $t_{B}$, $t_{A,out}$) and total vesicle diameter size ($D_{vesicle}$). We can see that with an appropriate population size and number of generations, the GA is able to accurately capture the target structure's dimensions. Additionally, while the analytical fitting to a core-multi-shell model using SASVIEW can also determine these structural dimensions, GA for vesicle is able to inform the user how the molecules are split between the inner and outer layers of the vesicle wall ($s_{Ain}$), a piece of molecular information not available to traditional method of analytical fitting. The GA determined parameter $s_{Ain}$ gives the fraction of molecules in the vesicle assembly that occupies the inner layer of the vesicle walls. For this example system, the target structure has 20% of the molecules in the assembly occupying the inner layer of the vesicle wall and the GA is able to determine $s_{Ain}$ as 28%, well matching the target value.\n",
